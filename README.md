## Cows are not infinite milk machines! <p style="font-size: 6pt;">(And shouldn't milk fill your stomach, too?)</p>

----

### Have you ever wondered why cows can give practically infinite amounts of milk and wondered why you can drink practically infinite amounts of milk?
And really, all that without having to eat even a tiny bit of grass? And the player can drink litres and litres of milk and doesn't get any less hungry?  
No, obviously that makes no sense and makes milk a way less cool item than it could be.
#### And that's why this mod is here to fix this:
+ Cows can now only be milked once, after which you have to wait until they decide to eat some grass (like sheep) to milk them again.
+ Cows eat grass approximately once or twice a day.
+ Milk fills your hunger bar and gives you saturation. (Same stats as a Golden Carrot.)
